## Php Has Another Parser

{% include_relative plug.md %}

## Roadmap

Currently I am still exploring the best API for these needs. Expect breaking changes while we travel down the road to 1.0.

In the meantime, you can get an idea of where we stand by perusing the [waffle board](https://waffle.io/ylixir/phap).

## Example code

[Right here](https://github.com/ylixir/phap/blob/master/test/Integration/functional_examples.php)

## References

Inspired from [this article](http://theorangeduck.com/page/you-could-have-invented-parser-combinators) and leaning heavily [on others wisdom](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/parser/latest/Parser)
