This release says goodbye to the OOP programming interface. It's been an awkward fit for a combinator library.
It has also proved to be too much work to maintain docs and tests for two interfaces with nothing but aesthetic
benefit.

I have also renamed the `or` and `and` functions to `alternatives` and `sequence` respectively. This should help to retain
the natural language flow found in the OOP interface. It also brings our
vocatulary more in line with other ecosystems.

The `end` function has been reconfigured to not take a parser as input. Use it with `sequence`

I have also added more example code in the `tests/Integration` folder. This includes an example of matching paremtheses (context free grammar)
along with a more elaborate example in the form of a json parser.
